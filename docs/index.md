Welcome to the OpenArc documentation! 

## Installation

- [Linux](install.md#linux)
- [Windows](install.md#windows)
- [Docker](install.md#docker)

## Commands

OpenArc includes a command line tool for controlling the server.

- [openarc add](commands.md#add) — Add a model to the config.
- [openarc list](commands.md#list) — List models added to the config.
- [openarc serve](commands.md#serve) — Start the OpenArc server.
- [openarc load](commands.md#load) — Load a model from the config.
- [openarc status](commands.md#status) — Check loaded models.
- [openarc bench](commands.md#bench) — Benchmarking tool for LLMs.
- [openarc tool](commands.md#tool) — OpenVINO utilities.

## Configuration

>Under construction!

- [Advanced openvino properties](configure.md#runtime_config)


## Concepts

- [Tool and Reasoning Parsing](tool_use.md#tool-and-reasoning-parsing)
- [Out-of-Process Inference Workers](worker-processes.md) — VLM/LLM/Whisper run in supervised worker subprocesses so unload/load always get a clean OpenVINO Core


## Models

Models to get you started and where to find more!

OpenArc is deeply integrated with the Huggingface Ecosytem and has been written from the ground up to handle a ton of deployment complexity but still demands some calories to choose what models to use. 

We are working on improving this process with experimental GGUF support coming, as well as a new frontend application similar to LM-Studio!

Below are some models to get started which are known to work. My huggingface has many 

- [Model Sources](models.md#sources)
- [LLMs](models.md#llms)
- [VLMs](models.md#vlms)
- [Text to Speech](models.md#text-to-speech)
    - [Whisper](models.md#whisper)
    - [Qwen3-ASR](models.md#qwen3-asr)
- [Speech to Text](models.md#speech-to-text)
    - [Kokoro](models.md#kokoro)
    - [Qwen3-TTS](models.md#qwen3-tts)
- [Embedding](models.md#embedding)
- [Rerank](models.md#rerank)
