"""Model config hashing: detect config changes and recompile on demand.

Every model entry in ``openarc_config.json`` carries a ``config_hash``: the
SHA-256 of the (path-resolved) load configuration the model was last
*compiled* with.

Why this exists: OpenVINO caches compiled model blobs in the model's
``cache_dir`` (see ``ModelLoadConfig.cache_dir``) and keys that cache by the
model *files* and the device -- **not** by the runtime/scheduler configuration.
So when a model entry changes (``--runtime-config``, ``--scheduler-config``,
device, ``cache_dir``, a re-run of ``openarc add``, a manual edit of
``openarc_config.json``, ...) a subsequent load can pick up blobs that were
compiled under the old settings. The stale graph then conflicts with the new
configuration -- load failures (e.g. ``CL_INVALID_EVENT`` / program-builder
errors) or inference with the wrong limits.

The rule applied by :func:`check_model_config_hash` at every model load:

1. Hash the configuration the model is about to be loaded with (the resolved
   ``ModelLoadConfig``, after the context window has been resolved, since the
   resolved window also reaches the compiled pipeline).
2. Look up the model's entry in ``openarc_config.json``.
3. If the stored ``config_hash`` differs from the current one -- including a
   missing stored hash, which is exactly what a freshly rewritten entry from
   ``openarc add`` looks like -- the compiled-model cache is invalidated so
   the pipeline is recompiled with the new settings.
4. The current hash is written back to the config file (unless the model is
   not in the file at all, e.g. a raw ``POST /openarc/load`` with no entry,
   in which case there is nothing to track and the cache is left alone so
   cache-less API users keep their cache reuse).

Hashing the *resolved* loader (absolute paths) keeps the value stable across
both load entry points -- server startup (:mod:`src.server.main`) and the
``openarc load`` CLI (``POST /openarc/load``) -- which resolve relative
``model_path`` / ``draft_model_path`` / ``cache_dir`` against the config
file's directory before loading.

    The canonical form is the JSON serialization of the *resolved*

    its own input. Two loads of the same logical config -- regardless of the
    key order in the JSON on the wire -- produce the same hash; any change to
    a configuration field (``runtime_config``, ``scheduler_config``, device,
    ``cache_dir``, the resolved ``context_window``, ...) changes it.

    The result is prefixed with the algorithm (``sha256:``) so the value is
    self-describing if the scheme ever changes.

    ``worker_line_limit`` is also excluded: it configures the IPC pipe between
    the server and the inference worker subprocess, not what OpenVINO compiles,

    documented way to force a recompile (see docs/models.md), and it is safe
    for models that are currently loaded: their graphs already live in memory,

    Best effort: a missing directory is a no-op, and a failure (e.g. a
