          ``context_window`` field and as ``meta.n_ctx`` so goose can
          auto-compact against it).

        When set to a positive integer it overrides automatic discovery and is
        used as-is. When None (or <= 0) the value is discovered from the model's
        config.json -- searched at the top level first, and (because multimodal
        models nest their language config under ``text_config`` / ``language_config``
        / ``llm_config`` / ...) then inside those nested per-modality sections --
