"""The worker's OWN log file.

Each worker's full logging (and any native C-level stderr) is redirected, at
startup in the worker, into a file beside the main log -- named after
`<base>.log` with `-worker-<model>` spliced in before the `.log`, so
`openarc.log` becomes `openarc-worker-<model>.log` in the same directory. The
supervisor hands that path to each worker in a per-model env var --
OPENARC_WORKER_LOGFILE_<model>, the dash in the model name written as an
underscore, one key per worker; a value already set there pins the file instead.
The worker also gets its model name, always, in OPENARC_WORKER_MODEL, so at
startup it looks up its OWN key exactly (not by a prefix scan, which a sibling
model's inherited key could fool); `_configure_logging` then redirects into it.
Only the worker ever writes to the file: the supervisor opens no file and merely
drains the pipe (forwarding nothing), so `openarc.log` keeps only the supervisor's
view of the worker.

These are the deterministic, subprocess-free halves: the filename derivation,
the env plumbing (the supervisor's _build_env passes the model name and the
per-model file key; the worker's _worker_logfile_from_env reads the latter by
exact name), and the pump now simply draining the quiet pipe. The real redirect +
a real worker writing to the file (and openarc.log staying clean of it) is
exercised end to end by tests/integration/test_worker_respawn_integration.py.
